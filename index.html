      "Kids with Guns"</a>by Gorillaz</h3>

      <p>The song is an indictment of children’s obsession with violence, particularly regarding the lifestyles
        glamorized by popular media which corrupts the youth. The lyrics were inspired by a boy in Damon Albarn’s daughter’s class who got in trouble for coming to school with a knife.</p>

      "Born Under A Bad Sign"</a>by Jimi Hendrix</h3>

      <p>The "bad sign" is an astrology reference: if you're "born under a bad sign," it means the stars are aligned against you from birth.
        It was the song's co-writer William Bell who came up with the title - he wanted to do a blues song about astrology.</p>


    <h3 id="mr-rager"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEolg577-DA">
      "Mr. Rager"</a>by Kid Cudi</h3>

      <p> This song was written as a ballad for Mr. Rager, Cudi’s impulsive persona and the title character of his second album,
        Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager. Cudi often refrences this sort of alter ego and even appears as two different people
        (himself and Mr. Rager) in the music video. </p>

    <h3 id="dirty-harry"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLnkQAeMbIM">
      "Dirty Harry"</a>by Gorillaz</h3>

      <p>Gorillaz craft a single that examines war and soldiers, reminiscent of Jedi Mind Tricks'
        “Uncommon Valor” in its first-person look at the battlefield.The song revisits some of the themes of earlier single “Clint Eastwood,”
        like violence and masculinity (indeed, it’s named after one of Eastwood’s better-known films).</p>

      "Then Came the Last Days of May"</a>by Blue Öyster Cult</h3>

      <p>According to guitarist Buck Dharma It’s the true story of three collegiate drug dealers who went to Tucson to score for the fall semester.
        They were ripped off and shot. While two of the guys died, the other survived to testify against the perpetrators, who were two young men from a notorious
        wealthy local family.They apparently served about ten years in prison before being released.</p>

    <h3 id="november-has-come"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGc9mgpvtxU">
      "November Has Come" </a>by Gorillaz</h3>

      <p>The song touches on the state of hip-hop, and dives into more abstract themes, such as the end of the world, and the coming apocalypse.
        In MF DOOM’s verses, he laments the fall of popular hip-hop. He’s not saying the medium is dead, but the glory days have come and gone.
        In 2D’s verses, he states that November has come— It’s almost December, or in other words, almost the end.</p>


      <h3 id="virtual-insanity"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JkIs37a2JE">
        "Virtual Insanity"</a>by Jamiroquai</h3>

        <p>“Virtual Insanity” is primarily about a dystopian future in which humanity is so dependent on technology that the world barely functions.
          They’re living in a kind of morbid virtual reality – hence the track’s title.</p>

    <h3 id="melissa"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71xvwVQABvw">
      "Melissa"</a>by Allman Brothers Band</h3>

      <p>The song was written by vocalist Gregg Allman long before the founding of the group. It was first written in 1967,
        and two demo versions from those years exists. The version on Eat a Peach was recorded in tribute to Duane Allman,
        who considered the song among his brother’s best and a personal favorite. </p>
