      "Kids with Guns"</a>by Gorillaz</h3>

      <p>The song is an indictment of children’s obsession with violence, particularly regarding the lifestyles
        glamorized by popular media which corrupts the youth. The lyrics were inspired by a boy in Damon Albarn’s daughter’s class who got in trouble for coming to school with a knife.</p>

      "Born Under A Bad Sign"</a>by Jimi Hendrix</h3>

      <p>The "bad sign" is an astrology reference: if you're "born under a bad sign," it means the stars are aligned against you from birth.
        It was the song's co-writer William Bell who came up with the title - he wanted to do a blues song about astrology.</p>


    <h3 id="dare"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAOR6ib95kQ">
      "DARE"</a>by Gorillaz</h3>

      <p>The song’s title supposedly came about due to guest vocalist Shaun Ryder’s thick Mancunian accent. He was unable to say the phrase
        “It’s There”, which was the song’s original title, so it was simply changed to “DARE.”</p>


    <h3 id="dirty-harry"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLnkQAeMbIM">
      "Dirty Harry"</a>by Gorillaz</h3>

      <p>Gorillaz craft a single that examines war and soldiers, reminiscent of Jedi Mind Tricks'
        “Uncommon Valor” in its first-person look at the battlefield.The song revisits some of the themes of earlier single “Clint Eastwood,”
        like violence and masculinity (indeed, it’s named after one of Eastwood’s better-known films).</p>

      "Then Came the Last Days of May"</a>by Blue Öyster Cult</h3>

      <p>According to guitarist Buck Dharma It’s the true story of three collegiate drug dealers who went to Tucson to score for the fall semester.
        They were ripped off and shot. While two of the guys died, the other survived to testify against the perpetrators, who were two young men from a notorious
        wealthy local family.They apparently served about ten years in prison before being released.
